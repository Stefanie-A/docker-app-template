# Docker App Template

This repository serves as a collection of Dockerfiles for various programming languages and frameworks, providing templates for building Docker images for different types of applications.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide developers with Dockerfile templates for popular programming languages and frameworks. Whether you're working with Python, Go, Rust, Node.js, or other technologies, you can find Dockerfile examples here to help you containerize your applications quickly and efficiently.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on programming languages or frameworks. Each directory contains one or more Dockerfile templates, along with any necessary configuration files or instructions specific to that language or framework.

- **Python/**: Dockerfiles for Python applications.
- **go/**: Dockerfiles for Go applications.
- **rust/**: Dockerfiles for Rust applications.
- **nodejs/**: Dockerfiles for Node.js applications.
- *Add more directories for additional languages or frameworks as needed.*

## Usage

To use the Dockerfiles provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory corresponding to your application's programming language or framework.

2. Choose the Dockerfile that matches your requirements. Each Dockerfile may have specific dependencies or configurations tailored to different use cases.

3. Copy the chosen Dockerfile into your project directory or use it as a reference to create your own Dockerfile.

4. Customize the Dockerfile as needed for your application. You may need to install additional dependencies or configure environment variables based on your specific requirements.

5. Build the Docker image using the `docker build` command:

   ```bash
   docker build -t myapp .
   ```

   Replace the image name with the desired name for your Docker image.

6. Run the Docker container using the `docker run` command:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 myapp
   ```

   Replace `5000` with the desired port mapping if applicable, and with the name of your Docker image.

7. Access your application in a web browser or test it using appropriate methods based on your application's functionality.
